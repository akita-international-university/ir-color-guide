# Code Review Instructions for README Files

This file provides instructions for GitHub Copilot code review when reviewing changes to the README.md (English) and README-ja.md (Japanese) files.

## Content Synchronization

When a revision is made to either `README.md` or `README-ja.md`, verify that the corresponding content in the other locale version is kept up-to-date. Flag any discrepancies where content exists in one version but not the other, or where changes have been made to one version without corresponding updates to the other.

## Translation Guidelines

### Document Title

- English: `IR Data Visualization Color Guidelines`
- Japanese: `IRデータ可視化配色ガイドライン`

### Organization Name

- English: `Akita International University`
- Japanese: `国際教養大学`
- The abbreviation `AIU` can be kept as-is in both versions

### Translation Consistency

- Ensure translations for the same words and phrases are kept consistent between sections and paragraphs within the Japanese document
- Technical terms and proper nouns should be translated consistently throughout the entire document

## Tone and Formality

- The Japanese version should maintain the same tone and level of formality as the original English document
- Use formal Japanese (敬体/です・ます調) consistently throughout the document to match the formal tone of the English version
